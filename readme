This package contains almost all the latex macros I heavily use in my tcs
research activity and, in particular, in the writing of conference and journal
articles. As few of my co-authors have kindly pointed out, and probably many
have thought, they are somehow a clear expression of an underlying ocd-like
behavior... hence the name!
